For further experimentations, we are using GoEmotions dataset with GRU model. Here we will be testing the accuracy of the model with STD and LWR. 

Testing different cases for better accuracy.

1. Entire dataset
2. Change neutral label to number of count = 4000
3. Change all label to number of count = 500 max
